myQ newer model garage door openers have these "digital" buttons where you can't just use a relay to act like the button is being pushed to open/close the garage door.  I used a spare remote opener to control both of my doors without the cloud and keep it all local and reliable.  In a later revision I will also be adding vehicle sensors to determine if a vehicle is parked in the spot for automating the doors opening and closing.

## Parts
[Project Box](https://amzn.to/3yq107O) to fit everything in and keep dust, bugs, etc out of.
