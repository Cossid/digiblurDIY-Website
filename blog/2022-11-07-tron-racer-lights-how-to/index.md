I've tried a bunch of different methods to have some tube looking lights in the yard.  I found some simple [white wire loom](https://amzn.to/3NFERIQ) looks great and is easy to keep straight.  It has an awesome look at night!  

I'm using [addressable pixels](https://amzn.to/3t4U2lt) on a [12v power supply](https://amzn.to/3WCEXVW) connected to the [LEDeez board](https://wantmoore.tech) running WLED.  Super simple to setup and wire up.
