Reolink has upped their game a bit with the PTZ person tracking cameras.  The have dual lenses to catch the action and zoom in on subjects as needed.  It is quite a neat concept but being their first deep dive into this realm they have some issues to work on with the camera shake.  Check out the video and still shots below.

Reolink still has a bit of a ghost effect with this camera.  I was unable to find a settings to remedy the situation.
