Have you outgrown the Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant?  Need something easy with more space and horsepower?  Look no further as unRaid is an easy Network Attached Storage solution that works great with Home Assistant.  No command line experience needed!  The docker management GUI of unRaid is second to none with easy installs, automatic updates, notifications, and more.
