The Martin Jerry Switches and Dimmers are pre-flashed and here!  No soldering, no exploits, just take them out of the box and pair them up on the WiFi.  Join the 100% local-control cool kids doing TASMOTA Device Groups and many other open-source features. If ESPHome is more of your game, upload your bin file to bring them into right into ESPHome using nothing more than your web browser.  

The ESPHome and TASMOTA template information can be found [here](https://digiblur.com/wiki/devices/switches/martin_jerry_mj-s01_single_pole).
