Two switches shown in the video:

[Martin Jerry Dimmer](https://amzn.to/2PyZASV)  
  
Did a rather short (sarcasm) live stream showing the process to break open the smart switch, identify features, flash tasmota, setup the template, etc. It was my first time doing this switch model and first time doing the real live stream.  
  
I also showed the bonus of the very cool new dimmer switch I've been working with on and off. It's very close and works out of the box right now as it is with a few Tasmota rules.  
  
Had a lot of fun and let me know if you'd like to see more of these (hopefully shorter next time!)
