For the folks using the awesome [Martin Jerry SD-01](https://amzn.to/33XdLWq) and [Tessan](https://amzn.to/2NyKXxJ)/[Acenx](https://amzn.to/2NzOoUO) MJ-SD02 dimmers, I've updated the fork to 6.6.0.6.  There aren't any additional features except for what came with the rebase on the updated base of Tasmota.  If you do decided to update your dimmers you'll need to select the MJ-SD01 module again after the reboot since the module number changes with this version.  More info on setup/flashing to be [found here](https://github.com/digiblur/Sonoff-Tasmota).  
  
Even though Tuya Convert seems to be getting more rare and rare each day, I updated the generic bin with wifi manager (AP mode) as default to 6.6.0.7 as well, this can be used for many other flashing applications too!  [Download here](https://github.com/digiblur/Sonoff-Tasmota/tree/development/generic).
