The LOHAS LED Bulbs utilize dual channels of warm white and cool white LEDs on the MY9231/MY9291 LED drivers.  We show in ESPHome how to solve this issue with a custom component.  All of the sample configurations used in the video can be found at the GitHub link below.  The Anoop bulb is a dual channel PWM light shown in Tasmota.  We also show how to easily configure the device using the new copy and paste templates of Tasmota.
