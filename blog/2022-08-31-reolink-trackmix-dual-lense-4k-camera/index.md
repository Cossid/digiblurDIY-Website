Reolink has upped their game a bit with the PTZ person tracking cameras.  The have dual lenses to catch the action and zoom in on subjects as needed.  It is quite a neat concept but being their first deep dive into this realm they have some issues to work on with the camera shake.  Check out the video and still shots below.
