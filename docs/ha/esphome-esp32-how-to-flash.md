## How to Install/Flash the Modern/Factory bin of ESPHome

There are two methods.  Choose the one you are more comfortable with.  Browser based ESPHome Web Flasher (easiest) or ESPTool.py command line.  Connect the device and ensure it is ready for installation/flashing.  Some devices require GPIO 0 to be held to ground, some require the Boot button to be held and some simply need to be plugged into USB.  This will vary per device.

Note:  After this intial flash/install, all updates/changes can be done via the "Update via Network" option without using this manual method of plugging in the device to the computer/host.

### Install the ESPHome Factory bin via a Web Browser

Open an additional tab to ESPHome Web Tools https://web.esphome.io/  

Click Connect and select the USB TTL adapter connected.  If you do not see one listed, follow the on screen help to load the correct drivers.

Hurry up and Wait! Some devices might require you to unplug and plug in the device to cycle power for them to boot up.  If you have GPIO 0 held to ground please remove this before trying to boot up the device into ESPHome.  Any additional updates/changes to the conifguration of the device can be done via the network update option.  Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
